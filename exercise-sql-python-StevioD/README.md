# SQL and Python

This repository explores the interoperability between
SQL and Python. 

One reason we've been using SQLite databases is because of 
how well they work with Python. In this "exercise" we'll create 
databases, build tables, fill them with data, and write queries. 

Before we get started, move one of the Wedge transaction files 
into the same folder. I've included one of mine so the code will 
run as written. Once you have your own owner files (where all of 
an owner's data resides in the same file), I encourage you to use 
one of yours. 
	
You'll need to download "OwnerTransactions_30.txt" before this
code will work. 

There are two notebooks in here: 

1. `SQL_and_Python`: This one gets us working with the interplay
between SQL and Python. We can create tables, run queries, and 
play with the output. There are a bunch of helpful pieces of 
code for the Wedge project. 

2. `SQL_and_Python_with_Functions`: Very similar to the above, but
most of the complicated DB stuff related to the Wedge is wrapped up in a 
functions to make the code cleaner and easier to read.
