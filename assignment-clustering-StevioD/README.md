# ADA Clustering In-Class & Assignment

This repo holds the clustering code that we may explore in class and will
also be the place you put your clustering assignment. I have included
code that does clustering both in Python and R. For the assignment
I recommend you use R, though you're free to use Python. 

This repo includes the following files: 

* `Clustering Surveys.ipynb`: We'll go through this code in class if time permits.
* `Clustering Surveys-Solutions.ipynb`: The solutions to the in-class work. 
* `clustering_code.py`: Helper functions from "Data Science from Scratch" that
perform K-means clustering. 
* `linear_algebra.py`: More code from DSFS, which has the needed linear algebra
functions that we use. 
* `r_example.r`: An R example of the clustering we'll do in class. 
* `survey_responses.txt`: The results of annual class surveys, building up 
a data set to perform clustering on. I'll post an updated version to Moodle 
if more results come in. 
* `clustering_assignment.rmd`: A starting point for the assignment. Instructions
for the assignment are in the document. 
* `washington_survey_data.txt`: Data for the assignment.
