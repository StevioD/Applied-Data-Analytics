# `dplyr` Assignment  

This assignment gives you an opportunity to practice `dplyr` commands and do a little analysis
on data you'll be quite familiar with. We'll replicate the queries from the Wedge Part 3. 

The instructions are in the RMD where you can write your code in the code blocks provided.
